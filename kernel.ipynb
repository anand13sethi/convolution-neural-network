In it, we work with Tensors which are n-dimensional arrays analogous to the numpy ndarray.\n\n#### Why?\n\n* Our code will now run on GPUs! Much faster training. Writing your own modules to run on GPUs is beyond the scope of this class, unfortunately.\n* We want you to be ready to use one of these frameworks for your project so you can experiment more efficiently than if you were writing every feature you want to use by hand. \n* We want you to stand on the shoulders of giants! TensorFlow and PyTorch are both excellent frameworks that will make your lives a lot easier, and now that you understand their guts, you are free to use them :) \n* We want you to be exposed to the sort of deep learning code you might run into in academia or industry.

See the end of the notebook for some links to helpful tutorials if you want to learn more or need further clarification on topics that aren't fully explained here.\n\n\n# Table of Contents\n\nThis notebook has 5 parts. We will walk through TensorFlow at three different levels of abstraction, which should help you better understand it and prepare you for working on your project.\n\n1. Preparation: load the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n2. Barebone TensorFlow: we will work directly with low-level TensorFlow graphs. \n3. Keras Model API: we will use `tf.keras.Model` to define arbitrary neural network architecture. \n4. Keras Sequential API: we will use `tf.keras.Sequential` to define a linear feed-forward network very conveniently. \n5. CIFAR-10 open-ended challenge: please implement your own network to get as high accuracy as possible on CIFAR-10. You can experiment with any layer, optimizer, hyperparameters or other advanced features. \n\nHere is a table of comparison:\n\n| API           | Flexibility | Convenience |\n|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Barebone      | High        | Low         |\n| `tf.keras.Model`     | High        | Medium      |\n| `tf.keras.Sequential` | Low         | High        |"

In this section we will start by building a model with basic TensorFlow constructs to help you better understand what's going on under the hood of the higher-level APIs.\n\nTensorFlow is primarily a framework for working with **static computational graphs**. Nodes in the computational graph are Tensors which will hold n-dimensional arrays when the graph is run; edges in the graph represent functions that will operate on Tensors when the graph is run to actually perform useful computation.\n\nThis means that a typical TensorFlow program is written in two distinct phases:\n\n1. Build a computational graph that describes the computation that you want to perform. This stage doesn't actually perform any computation; it just builds up a symbolic representation of your computation. This stage will typically define one or more `placeholder` objects that represent inputs to the computational graph.\n2. Run the computational graph many times. Each time the graph is run you will specify which parts of the graph you want to compute, and pass a `feed_dict` dictionary that will give concrete values to any `placeholder`s in the graph.\n\n### TensorFlow warmup: Flatten Function\n\nWe can see this in action by defining a simple `flatten` function that will reshape image data for use in a fully-connected network.\n\nIn TensorFlow, data for convolutional feature maps is typically stored in a Tensor of shape N x H x W x C where:\n\n- N is the number of datapoints (minibatch size)\n- H is the height of the feature map\n- W is the width of the feature map\n- C is the number of channels in the feature map\n\nThis is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `H x W x C` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the value of N from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be H x W x C, but we don't need to specify that explicitly). \n\n**NOTE**: TensorFlow and PyTorch differ on the default Tensor layout; TensorFlow uses N x H x W x C but PyTorch uses N x C x H x W."

This will take three basic steps:\n\n1. Compute the loss\n2. Compute the gradient of the loss with respect to all network weights\n3. Make a weight update step using (stochastic) gradient descent.\n\nNote that the step of updating the weights is itself an operation in the computational graph - the calls to `tf.assign_sub` in `training_step` return TensorFlow operations that mutate the weights when they are executed. There is an important bit of subtlety here - when we call `sess.run`, TensorFlow does not execute all operations in the computational graph; it only executes the minimal subset of the graph necessary to compute the outputs that we ask TensorFlow to produce. As a result, naively computing the loss would not cause the weight update operations to execute, since the operations needed to compute the loss do not depend on the output of the weight update. To fix this problem, we insert a **control dependency** into the graph, adding a duplicate `loss` node to the graph that does depend on the outputs of the weight update operations; this is the object that we actually return from the `training_step` function. As a result, asking TensorFlow to evaluate the value of the `loss` returned from `training_step` will also implicitly update the weights of the network using that minibatch of data.\n\nWe need to use a few new TensorFlow functions to do all of this:\n- For computing the cross-entropy loss we'll use `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits\n- For averaging the loss across a minibatch of data we'll use `tf.reduce_mean`:\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/reduce_mean\n- For computing gradients of the loss with respect to the weights we'll use `tf.gradients`:  https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gradients\n- We'll mutate the weight values stored in a TensorFlow Tensor using `tf.assign_sub`: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/assign_sub\n- We'll add a control dependency to the graph using `tf.control_dependencies`: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/control_dependencies"

      "source": "# Part III: Keras Model API\nImplementing a neural network using the low-level TensorFlow API is a good way to understand how TensorFlow works, but it's a little inconvenient - we had to manually keep track of all Tensors holding learnable parameters, and we had to use a control dependency to implement the gradient descent update step. This was fine for a small network, but could quickly become unweildy for a large complex model.\n\nFortunately TensorFlow provides higher-level packages such as `tf.keras` and `tf.layers` which make it easy to build models out of modular, object-oriented layers; `tf.train` allows you to easily train these models using a variety of different optimization algorithms.\n\nIn this part of the notebook we will define neural network models using the `tf.keras.Model` API. To implement your own model, you need to do the following:\n\n1. Define a new class which subclasses `tf.keras.model`. Give your class an intuitive name that describes it, like `TwoLayerFC` or `ThreeLayerConvNet`.\n2. In the initializer `__init__()` for your new class, define all the layers you need as class attributes. The `tf.layers` package provides many common neural-network layers, like `tf.layers.Dense` for fully-connected layers and `tf.layers.Conv2D` for convolutional layers. Under the hood, these layers will construct `Variable` Tensors for any learnable parameters. **Warning**: Don't forget to call `super().__init__()` as the first line in your initializer!\n3. Implement the `call()` method for your class; this implements the forward pass of your model, and defines the *connectivity* of your network. Layers defined in `__init__()` implement `__call__()` so they can be used as function objects that transform input Tensors into output Tensors. Don't define any new layers in `call()`; any layers you want to use in the forward pass should be defined in `__init__()`.\n\nAfter you define your `tf.keras.Model` subclass, you can instantiate it and use it like the model functions from Part II.\n\n### Module API: Two-Layer Network\n\nHere is a concrete example of using the `tf.keras.Model` API to define a two-layer network. There are a few new bits of API to be aware of here:\n\nWe use an `Initializer` object to set up the initial values of the learnable parameters of the layers; in particular `tf.variance_scaling_initializer` gives behavior similar to the Kaiming initialization method we used in Part II. You can read more about it here: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/variance_scaling_initializer\n\nWe construct `tf.layers.Dense` objects to represent the two fully-connected layers of the model. In addition to multiplying their input by a weight matrix and adding a bias vector, these layer can also apply a nonlinearity for you. For the first layer we specify a ReLU activation function by passing `activation=tf.nn.relu` to the constructor; the second layer does not apply any activation function.\n\nUnfortunately the `flatten` function we defined in Part II is not compatible with the `tf.keras.Model` API; fortunately we can use `tf.layers.flatten` to perform the same operation. The issue with our `flatten` function from Part II has to do with static vs dynamic shapes for Tensors, which is beyond the scope of this notebook; you can read more about the distinction [in the documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/faq#tensor_shapes)."

Maybe weight decay or dropout?\n\n### WARNING: Batch Normalization / Dropout\nBatch Normalization and Dropout **WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY** if you use the `train_part34()` function with the object-oriented `tf.keras.Model` or `tf.keras.Sequential` APIs; if you want to use these layers with this training loop then you **must use the tf.layers functional API**.\n\nWe wrote `train_part34()` to explicitly demonstrate how TensorFlow works; however there are some subtleties that make it tough to handle the object-oriented batch normalization layer in a simple training loop. In practice both `tf.keras` and `tf` provide higher-level APIs which handle the training loop for you, such as [keras.fit](https://keras.io/models/sequential/) and [tf.Estimator](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/estimators), both of which will properly handle batch normalization when using the object-oriented API.\n\n### Tips for training\nFor each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n\n- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n\n### Going above and beyond\nIf you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n\n- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n- Model ensembles\n- Data augmentation\n- New Architectures\n  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n  \n### Have fun and happy training!
